  s071824c.m aligns trial averages very well. s071824_1.m which is further along in the process and uses
  the transforms in s071824c.m does not align the time and trial averages well, look into it again.

    TODO: Why is s071824c.m aligning time averaged trials well but s071824_1.m does not 
                 align well?

                 Q: Can we get for mean(    Ke(:, :, TR = i, Time), 4) can we produce 
                      mean_matrices_in(:, :, 1)? 
                      
                        
                      s072124_1.m -- using trans_att_in element 4 and Kon_2{element}, we showed 
                                                up to Q3 that the trans_att_in can be produced from Kon_2
                                                using tform =  trans_att_in{element, 1}(tr) as the tform and
                                                I_shift = imwarp(I, tform, 'OutputView', outputView);

                 Q5: Can we do the same without I = nanmean(Ke(:, :, tr, :), 4)? Produce a series of
                        realigned frames using the same tform then average then do we reproduce I_shift? 

                        The answer is yes. However there are some trials that are not correlated. 
                        Which are those?
